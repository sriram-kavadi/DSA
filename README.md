# DSA – My Practice Repository (C++)

This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms problems that I’ve personally solved** during my learning journey.  
It’s a growing collection of practice problems, implementations, and solutions using **C++**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo

As I learned DSA step by step, I solved problems from different categories. This repo helps me:

- Track and organize all problems I’ve solved
- Review concepts when needed
- Build a reference library for future use
- Prepare for interviews and competitive coding

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder groups related problems or DSA topics that I practiced:
├── Array(2D) # 2D array problems I’ve solved

├── Array # 1D array problems

├── BST # Binary Search Tree related solutions

├── BitManipulation # Bitwise practice problems

├── LinkedList # Linked list implementations

├── OOPS # Object Oriented Programming exercises

├── Pointers # Pointer based problems

├── backtracking # Backtracking practice solutions

├── binaryTree # Binary tree traversals / tasks

├── deque # Deque practice

├── greedyAlgorithm # Greedy algorithm problems

├── hashing # Hash map/set based problems

├── o(nlogn)Sorting # Sorting problems with efficient algorithms

├── practise # Misc practice problems

├── priorityQueue # Priority queue examples

├── queue # Queue problems

├── recursion # Recursion based solutions

├── sort # Basic sorting practice

├── stack # Stack problems

└── strings # String manipulation problems

> Each folder will contain `.cpp` files for the problems I solved under that category.

## 💻 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sriram-kavadi/DSA.git
2. Navigate to a folder:
   cd Folder_Name
3. Compile and run a problem:
   
   g++ problem.cpp -o problem
   
   ./problem
   (Replace problem.cpp with the actual filename.)

🧠 Notes

All code is written in C++

- Focus is on correct logic and problem solving
- Not all solutions are optimized — this is a learning journey

📌 About Me

I upload problems I solved while learning DSA — this helps me track progress and improve problem-solving skills over time.
